About
=====
LUE is the result of multiple research projects performed by the
`Computational Geography`_ group at Utrecht University in The Netherlands.
One of the focus areas of this group is to improve on the concepts and
design of environmental modelling frameworks, with respect to their
functionality and performance. The LUE software allows us to test our
ideas. Our goal with LUE is to keep the ideas that work well, and
eventually turn the software into an environmental modelling framework
that is useful for domain experts.
