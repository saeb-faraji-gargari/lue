Release
=======

Releases are automatically archived on Zenodo. After making a release, a DOI is made available
by Zenodo which can be used in publications.

Checklist:

- Make sure the version number in the main CMakeLists.txt is correct
- Draft a release on Github. Currently we do not use the letter v to prefix version numbers.


Conda package
-------------

Conda-Forge detects new LUE releases automatically. In our case, Conda-Forge looks in a specific
location for a zipped tar file containing the LUE source files
(``https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/packages/src/lue-<version>.tar.bz2``). The first step
in creating a Conda package for a new release of LUE, is to upload a new zipped tar file to
this location. Example workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create a directory containing (only) the sources associated with the new release. Currently
   # it is relevant that this directory contains the .git subdirectory.
   mkdir -p tmp  # Whatever
   cd tmp
   # Update for actual tag associated with release
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue.git --branch 0.3.4 --single-branch
   tar cjf lue-0.3.4.tar.bz2 lue
   # Determine hash, to store in meta.yaml
   openssl sha256 lue-0.3.4.tar.bz2
   # ... ftp zip to ftp server ...

It may take a few hours for Conda-Forge to detect the new release. Once it has, a pull request
is created automatically, and all kinds of tests and builds are started
automatically. These may or may not succeed. Information about this can be found on the
`lue-feedstock page <https://github.com/conda-forge/lue-feedstock>`_ at Github.

The pull request is based on a new branch in a clone of the ``lue-feedstock`` repository, located
in the ``regro-cf-autotick-bot`` Github organisation. To make changes to this branch, the folowing
workflow can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository and checkout the branch associated with the PR
   mkdir -p development/project/github/regro-cf-autotick-bot  # Whatever
   cd development/project/github/regro-cf-autotick-bot
   git clone git@github.com:regro-cf-autotick-bot/lue-feedstock.git
   git checkout 0.3.4_h813c5f  # Update for actual branch mentioned in PR
   # ... make changes ...
   git push

.. important::

    Before merging the changes in the pull request's branch the build number in ``meta.yaml``
    must be correct:

    - In case LUE's version was bumped, the build number must be 0. This is done by the bot that
      created the pull request in the first place.
    - In case LUE's version was not bumped, the build number must be bumped by 1. In this case
      there was some other reason for rebuilding a Conda package.

Once the PR is fine, merge it into the main branch.
